# Script (2/5/21 Revision)

[Open with a silent 'spread' intro bumper]


[Scene 1]
Examples are a very important aspect of project progress. It allows us to create a rough framework so that others can see and understand what is going on, and so that we ourselves can come back and see where to work off of in the future. 

[Scene 2]
Take, for example, a student who is working an a project that requires many similar papers. They could work through each page from scratch again and again, or he could make an initial template and base everything off of it from there. We have A, the scratch method, and B, the template method. Which one would you be more inclined to choose? [Highlight both separately.]

[Scene 3]
Well this here is just a template too. Not a very good one though, not really any concrete ideas researched right now, and certainly not anything useful beyond this point. At some point here there will be a defining page for the structure of future scripts, such as how each aspect of a video will be layed out. Some indicator of an animation action, some way to signal pauses in speech, things like that.
