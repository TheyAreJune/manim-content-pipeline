For the sake of this video, let's first jump straight into the definition. [Show the CasesExample scene]. This is a hyperoperation... or at least the mathematical definition of one. It likely doesn't make much sense to you upon viewing it, but by the end of this video I hope to change that.

Let's look at this step by step first, starting with the notation. There are many notations, but I will just show the three you are most likely to encounter. The first is this basic notation of it. This is what it looks like (H_n(a,b)). The 'H' signifies it being a hyperoperation, the 'n' is the operation number, and both a and b being the values the binary operations occur on. Knowing these values here, we can easily conver this to Square Bracket Notation. No 'H' this time, just a, b, and n. Finally there is Knuth's up-arrow notation. This notation replaces n with up arrows, of which the number of these is shown by 'n-2.' Exponentiation, for example, has a single up arrow.

Now that we're out of the notation I can go on to describe what the information inside the case means. This defines rules such as "any value plus zero is the same as the initial value," "any number multiplied by zero is equal to zero," and "anything to the power of zero equals one." From there it defines the hyperoperation sequence beyond those cases.
