# manim-content-pipeline

---

This project is a personal endeavor of mine to create and operate a content creation pipeline for educational videos. Progress here will be rather slow, but it should be maintained at a decent rate.

### Content Types You May Find Here:
- Scripts (.md, .txt, .rtl)
- Rough Layouts (.md, .txt, .rtl)
- Storyboards (.pdf, .jpg, .docx, .rtl)
- Rough animation proofs-of-concept
  - Videos (.mp4)
  - Stills (.png)
  - Code (.py)
- Final Segment Renders
  - Videos (.mp4)
  - Subtitles (.srt)
  - Code (.py)
  - Links to Publish Location (YouTube)
  - Audio will not be provided separately

Each project will be stored in its own folder, with its own proper subfolders for each content type as well.

This work requires Manim CE in order to use. Manim CE is a mathematics-based animation library for Python. originally created by Grant Sanderson, the man behind the 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. More recently it has been picked up as an open source community project, and that version is what is being used here.
